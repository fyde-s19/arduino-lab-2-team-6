1. The duty cycle increases as the led gets brighter, decreases as it gets dimmer
.

2. Character representation of the data being sent.

3. ESP8266_2_Mega() takes 76.97ms.

4. ReadSensor() takes 1.014ms.

5. ESP8266_2_Mega() takes 11.43ms.

6. ReadSensor() takes 843 microseconds.

7. Serial monitor debugging prints new values as they update, while logic analyzers make it easier to compare data values as they change with time.

8. If the relative voltage of the logic analyzer's ground is different than that of the arduino, the data obtained will be off by some value.
